# RandomArt_NetworkingPractice
A small project to practice networking using the The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API

I wanted to push myself to get better with using the Result type, MVVM, and initializing my ViewControllers with my viewModels and networking objects. 
In this project I load in the various departments from the Metropolitan museum into a UIPickerView for the user to choose a department. Upon further revisions,
once the user presses the 'Random' button, a second call to the API will be made using the department ID to get back a an array of objectIDs, choose 
one at random, and display the art with some small info about it.
